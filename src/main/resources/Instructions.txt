Premier League

There are 20 clubs in the Premier League. During the course of a season (from August to May)
each club plays the others twice (a double round-robin system),

 once at their home stadium and once at that of their opponents', for 38 games.

 Teams receive three points for a win and one point for a draw.
 No points are awarded for a loss.

  Teams are ranked by total points, then goal difference,

   and then goals scored.

    If still equal, teams are deemed to occupy the same position.

 If there is a tie for the championship, for relegation, or for qualification to other competitions,
  a play-off match at a neutral venue decides rank.

 The three lowest placed teams are relegated into the EFL Championship,
 and the top two teams from the Championship, together with the winner of play-offs involving the third to sixth placed
  Championship clubs,
 are promoted in their place.
